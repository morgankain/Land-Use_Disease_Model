83.4,23,,Aedes,aegypti,,,Verdonschot and Besse Lototskaya 2013,Table 4,"Meta analysis so may be double dipping in some of these other citationsâ€¦ Need to go back through and check . Just want to make a note that there are a lot more citations with some number of loose or measured estimates, but not digging through and extracting all of that. Sometimes measure number re-caught in some binned distances, sometimes measures max etc. List of citations in the overleaf doc, can go back and get those if I want to later"
